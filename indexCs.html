    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>

        <p>
            Cuttlefish, or cuttles, are marine <a href="ds">molluscs</a> of the suborder Sepiina. They belong to the
            class Cephalopoda
            which
            also
            includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is
            used
            for control of buoyancy.
        </p>
        Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with
        which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest
        species,
        the giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass.[1]
        <p>
            Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopuses, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators
            include
            dolphins, larger fish (including sharks), seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy
            of
            a
            cuttlefish is about 1–2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent
            invertebrates.[2] Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[2]

        The Greco-Roman world valued the cuttlefish as a source of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from
        its
        siphon when it is alarmed. The word for the cuttlefish in both Greek and Latin, sepia, now refers to the
        reddish-brown color sepia in English.

        <h2>Etimology</h2>
        <p> "Cuttle" in "cuttlefish", sometimes called "cuttles",<sup>[3]</sup> is derived from the Old English name for
            the
            species,
            cudele. The word may be cognate with the Old Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).[4]

        <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
        <p>>Over 120 species of cuttlefish are currently recognized, grouped into six families divided between two
            suborders. One superfamily and three families are extinct. <a href="dsadasd"><sup>[5]</sup></a>

        <h3>cuttlebone</h3>

        <p>Unlike other cephalopods, cuttlefish possess a unique internal structure called the cuttlebone, a highly
            modified
            internal shell, which is porous and is made of aragonite. Except for spirula, they are the only coleoid
            cephalopods with a shell with a phragmocone divided into chambers separated by septa.[17] The pores provide
            it
            with buoyancy, which the cuttlefish regulates by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the chambered
            cuttlebone
            via the ventral siphuncle.[18] Each species' cuttlebone has a distinct shape, size, and pattern of ridges or
            texture. The cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, and is one of the features that distinguish them from their
            squid relatives.</p>
